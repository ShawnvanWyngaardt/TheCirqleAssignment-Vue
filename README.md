## A brief account of how I approached the assignment

First off, thank you for this opportunity and allowing me to showcase some of my skills and knowledge. Having this be my first Vue Project/Assignment, I took a few days to learn as much as I could about this new Javascript framework. 

I really enjoyed it, all of it. Including the frustrations of getting stuck, to the joy from successfully navigating and reasoning my way to getting everything to Just Work :D

#### In between the week of learning, I applied myself to the familiar tasks and routines I currently get to do in my role at Euromonitor.

- Breaking down the provided designs in preparation for the FE Build - [https://xd.adobe.com/view/14fff304-6515-4b58-832e-97808dafa1fc-41ac/]
- Building out the proposed solution in HTML and CSS to better undertand any possible limitations - [https://codepen.io/shawn-van-wyngaardt/pen/wvpyqJV]
- And yes, lots and lots of learning material - [Udemy with Max and a few devs who teach on Youtube]

There's more I'd like to mention about my approach and things that were mentioned during the initial two interviews, but I'll leave that for when you've reviewed my submission. This assignment should show a great deal about my skills for now.

Thanks again for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Tot ziens
